## Instructions

Did you ever played Mahong? Well this game it's similar. It improves your memory by matching pairs of cards. You should find the 8 pairs in the 16 cards deck. 

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer, provided by Udacity and Google. As FEND student, I've been provided with a starter project, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project, and was needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. Using gained skills I should modify the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file, adding functions to start the game, match/unmatch the cards, shuffle them, stars rating, time and moves counter. 

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
