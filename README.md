## Instructions

Did you ever played Mahong? Well this game it's similar. It improves your memory by matching pairs of cards. You should find the 8 pairs in the 16 cards deck. 

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer, provided by Udacity and Google. As FEND student, I've been provided with a starter project, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project, and was needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. Using gained skills I had to modify all files, specially Javascript file, adding functions to start the game, match/unmatch the cards, shuffle them, stars rating, time and moves counter, then publish the game to Github using Git bash. 

In order to play the game, you must find pairs of identical cards, the game is won when you manage to find the 8 pairs of cards available in the deck, then you'll a Pop-up -A modal, which was part of the project for us to include- in which you can see your rating, time and moves made throughout the game.

## Contributing

Most of this repo was build using the knowledge acquired on the FEND scholarship provided by Udacity/Google and with advice from a Mentor. Mainly the project was made with Vanilla Javascript and DOM manipulation. For some of the code, I've used some articles from websites to accomplish some of the functionality, such as w3schools and scotch.io/tutorials
